The Bipartite Network analysis app was created with *Shiny* and *Bipartite* package for *R*. 
The app was made to visualise a bipartite network for student projects.

### Data file format:
Save data file as a csv, with rows as plant species and columns as invertebrate species. If you have the abundance of each plant species, add abundance data as the last column.  

You can see the app in action here: https://aaronecology.shinyapps.io/Network/  

#### Example datasets from the Bipartite package:  
Safariland.csv  
Safariland_Abund.csv (has plant abundance data in the last column)
