# Bipartite Network  

The Bipartite Network analysis app was created with *Shiny* and *Bipartite* package for *R*. 
The app was made to visualise a bipartite network for student projects.

### Data file format:
Save data file as a csv, with rows as plant species and columns as invertebrate species. If you have the abundance of each plant species, add abundance data as the last column.
